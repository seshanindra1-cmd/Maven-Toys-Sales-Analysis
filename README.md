## 🛠️ Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Cleaned the raw toy sales dataset (handled missing values, format standardization)  
   - Structured data tables: sales, products, stores, dates, etc.  

2. **Data Modeling in Power BI**  
   - Imported cleaned tables into Power BI  
   - Defined relationships among tables (e.g., sales ↔ products, sales ↔ stores, date table)  
   - Created key measures using DAX (e.g. total revenue, profit margin, growth rate)  

3. **Dashboard Design & Visuals**  
   - Built interactive visuals:
     - Revenue & profit by region, store, product category  
     - Monthly & seasonal trends  
     - Top/low performing products  
     - Profit margin & growth trends  
   - Used slicers, filters & drill-throughs for deeper analysis
