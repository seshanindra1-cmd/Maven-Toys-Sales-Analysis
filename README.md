## 🛠️ Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   - Structured data tables: sales, products, stores, dates, etc.  

2. **Data Modeling in Power BI**  
   - Imported cleaned tables into Power BI  
   - Defined relationships among tables (e.g., sales ↔ products, sales ↔ stores, date table)  
   - Created key measures using DAX (e.g. total revenue, profit margin, growth rate)  

3. **Dashboard Design & Visuals**  
   - Built interactive visuals:
     - Bar cahrts showing high profitable stores and products with high sales
     - Line chart showing seasonal trends 
     - Pie chart showing the proportions of top 5 products sale with respect to others
     - Cards showing the inventory money,total profit and sales,yoy sales
   - Used slicers to drill through year and store location
